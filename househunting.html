                    Looking for a perfect home for yourself or you and your family is one of the biggest challenges one has to face, so many questions on what is important, what to fore-go, what to make your irreducible minimum, what amenities do I need, what do i want and what are bare luxuries.
                   <br>
                   We have done in-depth research and come up with these cheat sheet to help you while house hunting.
                   <br><strong>1. For Singles</strong>
                   <br>As a single person, you have the luxury of being as flexible as possible to get the best fit for yourself without compromising the comfort of anyone else. Nonetheless, there are some factors you will need to consider while house hunting, some we think should be your ceiling level and should not go beyond, and others that are easily compromisable depending on a persons priority.
                   <br><strong>Ceiling Levels</strong>
                   <br>The only two ceiling levels for a single's house hunting check list is the price and security. You should have a clear set amount that you should not go beyond according to your financial budget, do not be extravagant to get a lavish home and go to bed hungry, no matter how beautiful the space looks. You should never compromise on your personal security and that of your home no mater how much you will save by going for a space in a crime ridden location.
                   <br><strong>Flexible Levels</strong>
                   <br>This is the most fun yet challenging part of the house hunting process. Deciding the difference between what you need and what you want. For example, having to compare between two spaces, both within your ceiling level, you will now need to look at the pros and cons depending on your preferences as an individual. 
                   These vary from proximity to the tarmac and public transport for those late nights out for drinks with friends and early mornings to work, amenities such as social spots, hospitals, shopping areas and churches. These all vary from individual to individual.
                   <br><strong>2. For Couples</strong>
                   <br>As a couple, you have to decide on what is important for both parties involved. Not so different from that of a single person, the ceiling and flexible levels are all the same.
                   <br><strong>3. For Family</strong>
                   <br>As a family, many factors have to be considered before settling on which space to make your home. You do not have the flexibility as that of a singleton or a young couple, your decision are constrained to the comfort and ease of live for your family assuming that is the goal for every parent.
                   <br><strong>Ceiling Levels</strong>
                   <br>Apart from the pre-stated price tag and security, here we have to add some amenities that are very important for a family setting, such as proximity to a medical facilities for you never know when you will need to rush your child to a clinic in the middle of the night. You may also need to add proximity to a safe playing space for you child to use and most importantly, school, you don't want to get a beautiful space that will require your child to get up at 4am in-order for him to make it to school.
                   <br><strong>Flexible Levels</strong>
                   <br>Here is where parent get to be a bit selfish and do something that is solely for them disregarding the kids. We all need to blow off steam in order to raise a happily family, or at least I do. Be it being able to go to a your favorite drinking and eating spot on a friday night, a nice restaurant for date nights or a church to maintain spiritual upbringing for your family. These are decision parents make depending on what the consider to be most important to them.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Happy house hunting</strong>
